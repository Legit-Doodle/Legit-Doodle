# Introducing Nitin Singh Kanyal

I’m a passionate full-stack software developer with deep experience in building scalable web applications and cloud-native systems. With hands-on expertise across C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python, I love turning complex problems into elegant, reliable solutions.

I earned my B.Tech from IIT Jodhpur, and today I’m a Software Development Engineer (SDE 1) at Microsoft. In my current role, I design and maintain a suite of microservices that power personalized advertising across major Microsoft surfaces.

If you’ve ever unlocked your Windows screen and been greeted by a stunning landscape or a captivating visual—there’s a good chance you were looking at an MS Edge campaign delivered by the systems my team and I build. It’s exciting to see our work reach millions of users every single day.
